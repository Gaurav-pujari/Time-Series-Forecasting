# 📊 Airline Passenger Forecasting Using Time Series Models

## 📝 Project Overview

This project analyzes monthly airline passenger data to forecast future trends using classical time series decomposition techniques. Two primary models are explored:

* **Additive Model**: Assumes that the time series is a linear sum of trend, seasonality, and residual components.
* **Multiplicative Model**: Assumes that the components multiply together, suitable when seasonality and trend are proportional to the level of the series.

## 🎯 Goal

To **visualize**, **understand**, and **predict** the trend in air passenger demand over time using Python and time series modeling techniques.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

* Airlines, travel agencies, and logistics companies need accurate demand forecasting to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
* Time series decomposition helps understand the underlying structure — **trend**, **seasonality**, and **noise** — enabling better strategic decisions.
* Demonstrates foundational time series concepts that are applicable across many industries (retail, energy, finance, etc.).

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Pandas**: For data manipulation
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization
* **Statsmodels**: For time series decomposition
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development

## 📈 Key Highlights

* ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of airline passenger trends
* ✅ Decomposition of the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
* ✅ Comparison of Additive vs. Multiplicative models
* ✅ Interpretation of seasonal and trend behavior over time

## 🖼 Sample Output (Plots Included in Notebook)

* Time series plot of monthly airline passengers
* Decomposed plots showing:
   * 📉 Trend over time
   * 🔁 Seasonal patterns
   * 🔄 Residuals/noise

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains monthly airline passenger data typically spanning several years, featuring:
- **Time Period**: Monthly observations
- **Variable**: Number of passengers
- **Characteristics**: Shows clear trend and seasonal patterns

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- Loading and cleaning the dataset
- Converting date columns to datetime format
- Setting appropriate time series index

### Time Series Decomposition
- **Additive Model**: `passengers = trend + seasonal + residual`
- **Multiplicative Model**: `passengers = trend × seasonal × residual`

### Visualization
- Original time series plotting
- Component decomposition visualization
- Comparative analysis of both models

## 📈 Expected Results

### Additive Model
- Better suited when seasonal fluctuations remain constant over time
- Residuals should be randomly distributed around zero

### Multiplicative Model
- More appropriate when seasonal variations change proportionally with the trend
- Often provides better fit for growing time series data

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will understand:
- How to perform time series decomposition
